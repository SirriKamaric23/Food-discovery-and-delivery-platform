 Food discovery and delivery system
 Problem statement
In Cameroon, both residents and tourists frequently encounter difficulties when trying to find specific types of food in unfamiliar areas. Whether someone is searching for a traditional local meal or a popular international dish, the lack of reliable and accessible information often results in frustration and missed culinary experiences. Many people simply don’t know where to go or who to contact, especially when it comes to food delivery. This issue not only affects customers but also impacts small restaurants and food startups that struggle to gain visibility.
 Proposed solution

To solve this problem, we propose an innovative *Food Discovery and Delivery Platform* designed to connect users with a wide range of meal options across Cameroon. The platform will serve as a digital marketplace where restaurants—both established and newly launched—can sign up, create profiles, and showcase their menus. This allows users to search for food not just by restaurant name or location, but also by specific dishes, ingredients, or cuisine types. Whether someone is craving ndolé, jollof rice, shawarma, or a vegan salad, they’ll be able to easily find it through the app.
What truly sets our platform apart is its dual function as both a *discovery tool* and a *delivery service*. In many cities and towns in Cameroon, food delivery remains informal and inconsistent. Our platform will standardize this by enabling users to order food directly from the app, bringing convenience to those who prefer meals delivered to their homes, offices, or hotel rooms. 

Another key feature of the platform is the *community feedback system*. Users can leave reviews, rate their dining experiences, and recommend their favorite meals or restaurants. This not only helps others make informed choices but also builds trust in the platform. Over time, highly-rated local restaurants—many of which might be unknown to wider audiences—will gain greater exposure. This helps small businesses grow, while users benefit from discovering hidden food gems in their area.

For restaurant owners, the platform offers a low-cost way to reach more customers without the need for expensive marketing. They’ll also be able to update menus in real-time, post special offers, and respond to customer feedback. This increases engagement and improves service quality.
